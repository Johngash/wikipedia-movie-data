The first film in the series to not be directed by Wes Craven, following his death in 2015, the film is dedicated to Craven at the beginning of the closing credits.

The plot takes place twenty-five years after the original Woodsboro murders from Scream (1996), when yet another Ghostface appears and begins targeting a group of teenagers who are each somehow linked to the original killings. Similar to previous entries, Scream combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of black comedy and \"whodunit\" mystery to satirize the trend of reboots and legacy sequels (\"requels\"). The film also provides commentary on the horror fandom culture, particularly the divide between \"elevated horror\" and classic slasher films.",

He must survive the swamps while being chased by slave catchers and their dogs. Written by William N. Collage, the biographical film is loosely based on a possibly conglomerated story of the lives of either or both of two formerly enslaved Black men named Gordon and \"Whipped Peter\". That story was made famous by the photograph of a man's bare back heavily scourged from an overseer's whippings, published worldwide as magazine illustrations in 1863, and gave the abolitionist movement proof of the cruelty of slavery. Ben Foster stars as a ruthless slave hunter and Charmaine Bingwa as an enslaved wife and mother. The film employs an artistic desaturated color palette reminiscent of black-and-white film.",
